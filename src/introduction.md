# Introduction

This book presents the design and implementation of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program using Structured Text (ST). The assignment required the development of a PLC program based on a self-chosen process, with the flexibility to translate a personal routine into code. In my case the process that i chose was my morning routine

The PLC program consists of two independently running tasks, a function invoked by at least one task, and a Global Variable List (GVL) utilized for communication between the tasks. To ensure proper understanding and verification of the design, supporting documentation is provided using GIT version control, including a state diagram for each task, a sequence diagram illustrating the interaction between the tasks, and a sequence diagram showing the function call by one of the tasks.

This book will guide the reader through the development of the creative process behind the program in PLC, detailing the design.
