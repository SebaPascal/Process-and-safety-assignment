# State diagram

As part of this assignment, we were tasked with creating two state diagrams based on our daily routines. I chose to focus on the two routines that occur most frequently in my life. The first diagram outlines the process of having breakfast in the morning, while the second diagram represents the routine I follow after breakfast as I head to the university. These diagrams provide a clear breakdown of the different states and transitions within these daily activities.
